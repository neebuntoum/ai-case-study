Imagine having access to a robot that will polish your nails on demand. No appointments to make. No waiting in the lobby for the next available nail technicion. No more clearing an hour on your schedule anymore. A new startup company named Clockwork has delivered an automated nail polishing machine that can polish your nails in 10 minutes! Clockwork's goal is to free people from everyday tasks. Clockwork was founded October 2018 in San Francisco, previously known as Marionet, and has aquired over $6.2 million dollars from investors. Founder Erik Sunden and co-founders Renuka Apte and Aaron Feldstein are a dedicated team working towards developing revolutionary automation in elegance right to your fingertips.

## Business Activities

Clockwork specializes in building robots for selfcare. Focusing on airports and large retail stores such as Target as the leading providers of the nail polishing robot. The robot is also available in retailers and real estate like office lobbies and apartments. The estimated market size is close to $10 billion currently and is predicted to be close to $11.6 billion by 2027. Clockwork's competitors are Nimble and Coral. Nimble is an at home nail polishing robot and Coral is still in the prototype stage of production. Although Nimble has provided a way to apply a base and top coat evenly, the time spent on the machine is extraordinarily longer than than Clockwork's machine. This gives clockwork a major advantage in efficiency and allows them be an open market leader. Clockwork can establish branding uniquely and innovatively offering cutting edge features in time without immediate pressure to outpace competitors and can play a central role in influencing indutry standards for nail polishing robots. The machine uses AI and 3D technology. Utilizing Facebook's Detectron technology as the image segmentation to detect the nail bed area. Clockwork rolled out thier own network and labeling tool based on automated car software and gaming engines to focus on sub millimeter edges and allow for budget friendly data collection leading to faster results.  

## Landscape
Trends in Robotics:

In guiding our way through the complex landscape of this case study, it is imperative to embark upon a journey through the realm of robotic technology. It's a landscape characterized by technological breakthroughs and transformative trends. Understanding the broader trends in the robotics industry provides context to the subject at hand and unveil the external dynamics that influence its path.
Significant milestones and advancements have propelled the field of robotics into new frontiers. Over the past decade, the landscape has been marked by a series of achievements that have transformed the functionalities and applications of robotic technology.

As we embark on this exploration, key technological trends such as the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the evolution of sensory technologies, and the emergence of soft robotics, has become a driving force in automation, precision, and efficiency. Moreover, to comprehend the subject of our case study fully, it is essential to grasp the broader context within which it operates, a context intricately woven into the fabric of the evolving robotics landscape. We bring into focus the intricate dance between innovation, societal impact, and the very essence of technological evolution.

Some of the major companies in the robotics field are Fanuc, a Japanese company with a market capitalization of $27 billion, Symbotic, a US company with a market capitalization of $23 billion, KUKA, a German company that is one of the four largest manufacturers of industrial robots, Yamaha, a supplier of industrial robotics products and machines globally, and NVIDIA, involved in robotics and autonomous systems.
 
 ## Results

Clockwork has revolutionized the nail beauty industry by introducing an automated system that consistently applies nail polish in less time than a nail technician requires for the same service. Providing accessibilty and convenience, nail robots offer on demand services to on the go consumers. Clockwork is setting a new standard in integrating robots and AI to the beauty industry.  The economic consequences of adopting nail robots are multifaceted, ranging from potential cost efficiencies and productivity to challenges related to initial investments and regulatory compliance. While the robots can lead to job displacement for many salon workers, it can also add jobs for skilled technicians that are intersted in maintaining robotic systems. The fundamental performance that is crucial for the success and effectiveness of the machine is to polish nails comprable tp a humans capabilities. To effectively assess the machine's success, it must demonstrate cost efficiency, deliver consistent and satisfactory performance, and utilize optimal products in its service delivery. Clockwork's performace has successfully bypassed all of it competitors in all 3 areas. 

## Recommendations
I would recommend using a three to five  prong holding device for an existing polish brush. Utilizing more moving parts will allow for a more detailed application closer to human movements. Using existing polish will also reduce initial investment making the robot more attractive to not only high end salons but to salons with minimal working capital. I would also incorporate a UV/Led light so gel polish can be used instead of a fan to dry polish. Gel polish is the main reason consumers go to salons today. The instant drying polish allows for consumers to continue their on the go lifestyle and the service can be offered at a higher price point giving salons a faster return on the investment. Another improvement is a hand holding platform to consistently hold the persons hand in place. The current strap in method allows too much room for inconsistencies. I believe that implementing these modifications would enable the machine to adapt more effectively to the current market, particularly given the heightened demand of gel polish compared to the existing version. The incorporation of soft robotics into this machine will impart a human-like touch, elevating its capabilities to that is required for a high-performing nail polishing robot.
